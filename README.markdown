What is MenialTasks?
======================
MenialTasks is, as the name suggests, a super-simple tasklist app. It's only intended as an example for my Introduction to MVVM in Delphi session from CodeRage 7. It is the bare minimum of functionality I needed to show off a couple of key topics in MVVM, such as dealing with child Views/ViewModels, etc.

NB: Now updated for 10.2 Tokyo. Also uses FireUI to tailor the Views for different platforms.
